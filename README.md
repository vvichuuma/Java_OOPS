# Java_OOPS
Object oriented programming concepts: 

#Access Modifiers: 
Private - Members of this class can access only within that particular class.
Public - Members of this class can be used anywhere in the program.
Protected - Members of that particular package and all the subclasses and all the sub classes of different package. 
Default - Can only be accessed within the same package. 

#Encapsuation - It is the binding up of the properties of a class with that of it's methods. 

#Inheritance - It is where you are inheriting from the parent class , it's properties and 
it's methods can be used in the child class. 

#Polymorphism - It involves two concepts - 
1). Method Overloading - If you are using the same methods but with different parameters within the same class. 
2). Method Overriding - If you are using the same method name with the same parameter but in different classes(inheriting). 

#Abstraction - 
Data abstraction - IT is the process of displaying only the essential information and hiding the details. 
For Eg : Using ACCESS MODIFIERS to display PUBLIC (or) PRIVATE for the properties.

//Abstract classes : An abstract class should have atleast one abstract method. It is like a regular class but with abstract 
methods in it.
Abstract methods - they are methods which doesn't have a body and they are meant to be overridden. 
- These are certain methods which the child classes have unique characteristics while inherting from the parent , so they 
have to be overwritten.

//Interfaces - contains only abstract methods. There are no generalized methods in an Interface. Say each of your subclass
have methods that are absolutely unique to that particular sub class then we use interface. You can only implement an interface.
IT is not a class so you can't extend, you can only use implement.
